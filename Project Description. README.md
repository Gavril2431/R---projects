This project is mainly foccused on studying the sales of the various cars throughout a region.

We have performed EDA on the data, Got insghts on who, where and why have they purchased the car. We have also got some insights on which factors of the cars contribute to their sales.

I have also included a  small prediction algorithm that predicts the sales of these cars. This algo. is based on the simple linear regression model.
